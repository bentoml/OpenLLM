"""Filename matching with shell patterns.

fnmatch(FILENAME, PATTERN) matches according to the local convention.
fnmatchcase(FILENAME, PATTERN) always takes case in account.

The functions operate by translating the pattern into a regular
expression.  They cache the compiled regular expressions for speed.

The function translate(PATTERN) returns a regular expression
corresponding to PATTERN.  (It does not compile it.)
