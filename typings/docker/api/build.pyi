        """Similar to the ``docker build`` command. Either ``path`` or ``fileobj``
        needs to be set. ``path`` can be a local path (to a directory
        containing a Dockerfile) or a remote URL. ``fileobj`` must be a
        readable file-like object to a Dockerfile.

        If you have a tar file for the Docker build context (including a
        Dockerfile) already, pass a readable file-like object to ``fileobj``
        and also pass ``custom_context=True``. If the stream is compressed
        also, set ``encoding`` to the correct value (e.g ``gzip``).

        Example:
            >>> from io import BytesIO
            >>> from docker import APIClient
            >>> dockerfile = '''
            ... # Shared Volume
            ... FROM busybox:buildroot-2014.02
            ... VOLUME /data
            ... CMD ["/bin/sh"]
            ... '''
            >>> f = BytesIO(dockerfile.encode('utf-8'))
            >>> cli = APIClient(base_url='tcp://127.0.0.1:2375')
            >>> response = [line for line in cli.build(
            ...     fileobj=f, rm=True, tag='yourname/volume'
            ... )]

        Args:
            path (str): Path to the directory containing the Dockerfile
            fileobj: A file object to use as the Dockerfile. (Or a file-like
                object)
            tag (str): A tag to add to the final image
            quiet (bool): Whether to return the status
            nocache (bool): Don't use the cache when set to ``True``
            rm (bool): Remove intermediate containers. The ``docker build``
                command now defaults to ``--rm=true``, but we have kept the old
                default of `False` to preserve backward compatibility
            timeout (int): HTTP timeout
            custom_context (bool): Optional if using ``fileobj``
            encoding (str): The encoding for a stream. Set to ``gzip`` for
                compressing
            pull (bool): Downloads any updates to the FROM image in Dockerfiles
            forcerm (bool): Always remove intermediate containers, even after
                unsuccessful builds
            dockerfile (str): path within the build context to the Dockerfile
            gzip (bool): If set to ``True``, gzip compression/encoding is used
            buildargs (dict): A dictionary of build arguments
            container_limits (dict): A dictionary of limits applied to each
                container created by the build process. Valid keys:

                - memory (int): set memory limit for build
                - memswap (int): Total memory (memory + swap), -1 to disable
                    swap
                - cpushares (int): CPU shares (relative weight)
                - cpusetcpus (str): CPUs in which to allow execution, e.g.,
                    ``"0-3"``, ``"0,1"``
            decode (bool): If set to ``True``, the returned stream will be
                decoded into dicts on the fly. Default ``False``
            shmsize (int): Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes. The size must be
                greater than 0. If omitted the system uses 64MB
            labels (dict): A dictionary of labels to set on the image
            cache_from (:py:class:`list`): A list of images used for build
                cache resolution
            target (str): Name of the build-stage to build in a multi-stage
                Dockerfile
            network_mode (str): networking mode for the run commands during
                build
            squash (bool): Squash the resulting images layers into a
                single layer.
            extra_hosts (dict): Extra hosts to add to /etc/hosts in building
                containers, as a mapping of hostname to IP address.
            platform (str): Platform in the format ``os[/arch[/variant]]``
            isolation (str): Isolation technology used during build.
                Default: `None`.
            use_config_proxy (bool): If ``True``, and if the docker client
                configuration file (``~/.docker/config.json`` by default)
                contains a proxy configuration, the corresponding environment
                variables will be set in the container being built.

        Returns:
            A generator for the build output.

        Raises:
            :py:class:`docker.errors.APIError`
                If the server returns an error.
            ``TypeError``
                If neither ``path`` nor ``fileobj`` is specified.
