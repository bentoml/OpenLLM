  "This namespace is a wrapper for the IndexedDB API. It provides
   functions to create object stores, add objects to them and retrieve
   objects from them.

   The functions in this namespace are meant to be used by other
   namespaces, which will provide a higher level API for the application
   to use.

   If you stumble upon a parameter named `obj-store-fqn`, this is the fully
   qualified name of the object store. This name (or identifier rather)
   must consist of a map with two keys: `:db-name` and `:os-name`. `:db-name`
   must be a string, which identifies the database. `:os-name` must be a
   string, which is the name of the object store."

   interact with the database and object store. For more information see:
   `obj-store-fqn` docstring of this namespace.

   The `:index` key is a vector of maps, each of which will describe one
   index (the equivalend of a field in a SQL table) of the object store.

   Optionally, you may pass a `success-callback` function, which will be
   called when the database is initialized. The function will be called
   with no arguments.

   Also optionally, you can pass an `on-upgrade` callback function, which
   will be called when the database is upgraded to a new version. The
   function will be called with the old version number as its first
   and the new version as it's second argument. If you do pass a function,
   it will be called *instead* of the default callback function. This
   means, that you will have to create the object store yourself!
   An example of how to do this:
   ```clojure
   (create-object-store! {:db-name db-name :os-name store-name}
                         your-table-definition)
