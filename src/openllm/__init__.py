"""OpenLLM.

An open platform for operating large language models in production. Fine-tune, serve,
deploy, and monitor any LLMs with ease.

* Built-in support for StableLM, Llama 2, Dolly, Flan-T5, Vicuna
* Option to bring your own fine-tuned LLMs
* Online Serving with HTTP, gRPC, SSE(coming soon) or custom API
* Native integration with BentoML and LangChain for custom LLM apps
