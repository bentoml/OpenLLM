    ## Fine tuning OPT

    This script demonstrate how one can easily fine tune OPT
    with [LoRa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) and in int8 with bitsandbytes.

    It is based on one of the Peft examples fine tuning script.
    It requires at least one GPU to be available, so make sure to have it.

    ## Fine tuning Falcon

    This script demonstrate how one can fine tune Falcon using [QLoRa](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf),
    [trl](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl).

    It is trained using OpenAssistant's Guanaco [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco)

    It requires at least one GPU to be available, so make sure to have it.
