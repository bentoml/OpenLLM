## Usage

Currently, StarCoder only supports PyTorch. Make sure ``torch`` is available in your system.

\b
StarCoder Runner will use bigcode/starcoder as the default model. To change to any other StarCoder
saved pretrained, or a fine-tune StarCoder, provide ``OPENLLM_STARCODER_MODEL_ID='bigcode/starcoder'``
or provide `--model-id` flag when running ``openllm start starcoder``:

\b
$ openllm start starcoder --model-id 'bigcode/starcoder'
