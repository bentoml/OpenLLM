This is a BentoML example project, showing you how to serve and deploy open-source Large Language Models using [vLLM](https://vllm.ai), a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference engine.

See [here](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-what-you-can-build-with-bentoml) for a full list of BentoML example projects.

💡 This example is served as a basis for advanced code customization, such as custom model, inference logic or vLLM options. For simple LLM hosting with OpenAI compatible endpoint without writing any code, see [OpenLLM](https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM).


## Prerequisites

- You have installed Python 3.8+ and `pip`. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.
- You have a basic understanding of key concepts in BentoML, such as Services. We recommend you read [Quickstart](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/1.2/get-started/quickstart.html) first.
- If you want to test the Service locally, you need a Nvidia GPU with at least 16G VRAM.
- (Optional) We recommend you create a virtual environment for dependency isolation for this project. See the [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for details.

## Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentoml/BentoVLLM.git
cd BentoVLLM/mistral-7b-instruct
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -f -U "pydantic>=2.0"
```

## Run the BentoML Service

We have defined a BentoML Service in `service.py`. Run `bentoml serve` in your project directory to start the Service.

```bash
$ bentoml serve .

2024-01-18T07:51:30+0800 [INFO] [cli] Starting production HTTP BentoServer from "service:VLLM" listening on http://localhost:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:501] Capturing the model for CUDA graphs. This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI.
INFO 01-18 07:51:40 model_runner.py:505] CUDA graphs can take additional 1~3 GiB memory per GPU. If you are running out of memory, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or enforcing eager mode.
INFO 01-18 07:51:46 model_runner.py:547] Graph capturing finished in 6 secs.
```

The server is now active at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You can interact with it using the Swagger UI or in other different ways.

<summary>CURL</summary>

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:3000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: text/event-stream' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "prompt": "Explain superconductors like I'\''m five years old",
  "tokens": null
}'
```

<summary>Python client</summary>

```python
import bentoml

with bentoml.SyncHTTPClient("http://localhost:3000") as client:
    response_generator = client.generate(
        prompt="Explain superconductors like I'm five years old",
        tokens=None
    )
    for response in response_generator:
        print(response)
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>OpenAI-compatible endpoints</summary>

This Service uses the `@openai_endpoints` decorator to set up OpenAI-compatible endpoints (`chat/completions` and `completions`). This means your client can interact with the backend Service (in this case, the VLLM class) as if they were communicating directly with OpenAI's API. This [utility](mistral-7b-instruct/bentovllm_openai/) does not affect your BentoML Service code, and you can use it for other LLMs as well.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:3000/v1', api_key='na')

# Use the following func to get the available models
client.models.list()

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Explain superconductors like I'm five years old"
        }
    ],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in chat_completion:
    # Extract and print the content of the model's reply
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
```

**Note**: If your Service is deployed with [protected endpoints on BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html#access-protected-deployments), you need to set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your BentoCloud API key first.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_BENTOCLOUD_API_TOKEN}
```

You can then use the following line to replace the client in the above code snippet. Refer to [Obtain the endpoint URL](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/call-deployment-endpoints.html#obtain-the-endpoint-url) to retrieve the endpoint URL.

```python
client = OpenAI(base_url='your_bentocloud_deployment_endpoint_url/v1')
```

</details>

For detailed explanations of the Service code, see [vLLM inference](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/use-cases/large-language-models/vllm.html).

## Deploy to BentoCloud

After the Service is ready, you can deploy the application to BentoCloud for better management and scalability. [Sign up](https://www.bentoml.com/) if you haven't got a BentoCloud account.

Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html), then run the following command to deploy it.

```bash
bentoml deploy .
```

Once the application is up and running on BentoCloud, you can access it via the exposed URL.

**Note**: For custom deployment in your own infrastructure, use [BentoML to generate an OCI-compliant image](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html).


## Different LLM Models

Besides the mistral-7b-instruct model, we have examples for other models in subdirectories of this repository. Below is a list of these models and links to the example subdirectories.

- [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2](mistral-7b-instruct/)
- [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 with gptq quantization](mistral-7b-instruct/)
- [Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](llama2-7b-chat/)
- [SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0](solar-10.7b-instruct/)


## LLM tools integration examples

- Every model directory contains codes to add OpenAI compatible endpoints to the BentoML service.
- [outlines-integration/](outlines-integration/) contains the code to integrate with [outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines) for structured generation.
