### openllm-core

Bump `attrs` to `23.2.0`

Added experimental helpers `.pydantic_model()` functions to convert current attrs-based class to its compatible pydantic class.

### openllm

Updated OpenLLM architecture to new 1.2 BentoML.

`openllm.Runner` remains the old Runnable implementation. Therefore, if you still depends on the old architecture, make sure to use `openllm.Runner` instead of `llm.runner`.

`llm.runner` will now become an `bentoml.depends()` singleton, therefore, to avoid breaking change, make sure to set `OPENLLM_RUNNER_BEHAVIOUR=deprecated` in your environment variable. This is the default behaviour. To opt-in the new architecture, set `OPENLLM_RUNNER_BEHAVIOUR=new_impl`
