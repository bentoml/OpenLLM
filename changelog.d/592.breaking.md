## Revamped CLI interface

This is a part of the recent restructure of `openllm.LLM`

For all CLI, there is no need to pass in the architecture anymore. One can directly pass in the model and save a few characters

Start:

```bash

openllm start meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf --device 0

```

Build:

```bash

openllm build meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf --serialisation safetensors

```

All CLI outputs will now dump JSON objects to stdout. This will ensure easier programmatic access to the CLI.
This means `--output/-o` is removed from all CLI commands, as all of them will output JSON.
