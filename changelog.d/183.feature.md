Importing models now won't load into memory if it is a remote ID. Note that for GPTQ and local model the behaviour is unchanged.

Fixes that when there is one GPU, we ensure to call `to('cuda')` to place the model onto the memory. Note that the GPU must have
enough VRAM to offload this model onto the GPU.
