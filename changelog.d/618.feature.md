Certain warnings can now be disabled with `OPENLLM_DISABLE_WARNINGS=True` in the environment.

`openllm.LLM` now also brings `embedded` mode. By default this is True. if `embedded=True`, then
the model will be loaded eagerly. This should only be used during developmen

```python

import openllm

llm = openllm.LLM('HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta', backend='vllm', embedded=True)
```

The default behaviour of loading the model first time when `llm.generate` or `llm.generate_iterator` is unchanged.
`embedded` option is mainly for backward compatibility and more explicit definition.
