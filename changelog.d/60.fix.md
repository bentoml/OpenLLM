Moved implementation of dolly-v2 and falcon serialization to save PreTrainedModel instead of pipeline.

Save dolly-v2 now save the actual model instead of the pipeline abstraction. If you have a Dolly-V2
model available locally, kindly ask you to do `openllm prune` to have the new implementation available.

Dolly-v2 and falcon nows implements some memory optimization to help with loading with lower resources system

Configuration removed field: 'use_pipeline'
