We will deprecate support for PyTorch backend and will enforce all
built Bento to use vLLM backend going forward. This means that `openllm build`
with `--backend pt` will now be deprecated and move to `--backend vllm`.

We will focus more on contributing upstream to vLLM and will ensure that the core
value of OpenLLM is to provide a flexible and as streamlined experience to bring these
models to production with ease.

PyTorch backend will be removed from 0.5.0 releases onwards.

The docker images will now only be available on GHCR and not on ECR anymore as a measure
to reduce cost and maintenance one our side
