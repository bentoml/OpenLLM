`openllm.LLM` now generates tags based on given `model_id` and optional
`model_version`.

If given `model_id` is a custom path, the name would be the basename of the
directory, and version would be the hash of the last modified time.

`openllm start` now provides a `--runtime`, allowing setup different runtime.
Currently it refactors to `transformers`. GGML is working in progress.

Fixes miscellaneous items when saving models with quantized weights.
