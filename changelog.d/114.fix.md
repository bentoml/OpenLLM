Fixes resources to correctly follows CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES spec

OpenLLM now contains a standalone parser that mimic `torch.cuda` parser for set
GPU devices. This parser will be used to parse both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

`openllm` should now be able to parse `GPU-` and `MIG-` UUID from both
configuration or spec.
